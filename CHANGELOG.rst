3.0.2

* Do not publish property value if value is ``None``

3.0.0
-----

* Add support for the new MicroPython uasyncio V3 implementation
* Updated mqtt_as.py version for uasyncio v3
* New uasyncio V3 primitives from Peter Hinch
* Remove update asyncio coroutine. Property data attributes are now published immediately on value assignment
* Add available Homie Extensions to constants. Updated ``settings.example.py`` with an example
* Subscribe to the Homie broadcast topic is now optional and enabled by default
* The ``utils`` module was refactored to ``homie.network``. This will break ``boot.py`` on update. Replace ``homie.utils`` with ``homie.network`` in ``boot.py`` and other files where you use the ``utils`` module.
* Add validation for datatype integer
* Add the possibility to store multiple WiFi credentials
* Refactored classes
* New filesystem LFS2. Disabled vfat to safe space.
